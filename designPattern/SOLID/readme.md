# SOLID Principle

These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells and refactoring code for software development.

SOLID stands for:
S - Single-responsiblity Principle
O - Open-closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle

SPR:
- A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
- Otherwise, the class would become GOD object which have multiple responsibles.
- Example will be persistence(repository layer), business logic(service layer)
