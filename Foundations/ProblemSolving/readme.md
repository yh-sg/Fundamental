# Problem solving approach
---

## 1. Understand the problem
- Can I **restate** the problem in my own words?
- What are the inputs that go into the problem
- What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
- Can the ***outputs be determined from the inputs***? In other words, do i have enough info to solve the problem?
- How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## 2. Explores Examples
- Start with simple Examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with ***empty*** inputs
- Explore examples with ***invalid*** inputs

## 3. Break it down

## 4. Solve/Simplify
- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore/breakdown that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution (***Naive Solution***)
- Then incorporate that difficulty/pieces back in

## 5. Look back and refactor
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you understand it ***at a glance***?
- Can you improve the performance of your solution?
- Can you think of other ways to refactor?
- How would other people solved this problem?

### Devise a plan for solving problem and master common problem solving patterns!

### What are the some pattern?
- ***Frequency counter, multiple pointers, sliding window, divide and conquer***
- (Bonuses) Dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, backtracking and many more!
