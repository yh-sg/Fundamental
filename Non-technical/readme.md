**Resume Cheat Sheet**
---------------

Those without ✅ are for me to track whenever I'm applying to different position. 
With ✅ are checklist need to scanthrough after completing resume.

Include words from job description  
Does your first item on your resume reflect what they are looking for?  
Experience titles demonstrate value - Show your value on the work experience.
Are you using Action words?  
Measure everything in terms of impact, don’t just describe your responsibilities  
Technical Knowledge/Skills should include what they are looking for. Only show years if it is impressive  
✅ ~~Use a pre-designed resume template~~
✅ ~~Make the resume fit on 1 page~~   
✅ ~~Do you have an online link?~~ 
✅ Remove the word “I”  
✅ No buzzwords describing how great you are 
✅ ~~Include only sections/items that are impressive:~~
    ✅ ~~Experience~~
    Projects(Maybe portfolio?)
    ✅ ~~Education~~
    ✅ ~~Technical Skills~~  
✅ No typos or bad grammar
