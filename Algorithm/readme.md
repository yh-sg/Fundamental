# Algorithm

## 1. Searching
---
## Linear Search
---
- Search for value one by one
- E.g. IndexOf(), includes()
- Time Complexity:
    - Best: O(1)
    - Average: O(N)
    - Worst: O(N)

---
## Binary Search
---
- Elimate half of the remaining elements at a time
- Works only in sorted arrays!
- Divide and Conquer
- Time Complexity:
    - Best: O(1)
    - Average: O(log n)
    - Worst: O(log n)
