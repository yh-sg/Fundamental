# Sorting

## Bubble Sort
- Using **optimized approach**. it can detect already sorted array in first pass with time complexity of O(N)
- Unless know the data is fairly sorted, this should be avoided, bubbles up.
- Time Complexity:
    - Best: O(N)
    - Average: O(n^2)
    - Worst: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity:
    - O(1)

---
## Selection Sort
- Simplest sorting approach. Find the smallest of all the elements and swap it from the position.
- No best case scenario
- Time Complexity:
    - All case: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity:
    - O(1)

---
## Insertion Sort
---
- The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part.
- Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
- For small data values, insertion sort performs efficiently.
- Time Complexity:
    - Best: O(N)
    - Average: O(n^2)
    - Worst: O(n^2)
- Space Complexity:
    - O(1)
