What is AJAX?
AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX just uses a combination of:
    -A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    -JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

Advantages:
    - Update a web page without reloading the page
    - Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
    - Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
    - Send data to a server - in the background
