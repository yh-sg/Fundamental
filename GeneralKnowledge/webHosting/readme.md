### Common types of web hosting
- Shared Web Hosting
    - A website is hosted on the same server as many other websites. 
    - Most web hosting companies provide shared hosting. 
    - No administration issues : web host will usually be responsible for administration and maintenance of the hardware (+)
    - Low cost: New sites which don’t expect a lot of traffic in the short term for personal project and small-sized businesses (+)
    - Low Entry: Designed for beginners and tech novices (+)
    - Performance issue : Not suitable for large sites with lots of traffic. (-)
    - File permission risks: Incorrectly configured file permission settings could allow fellow users of the server to access your files (-)
    - Lack of admin access: Lack of root access might impact on your ability to perform admin tasks (-)
- VPS Hosting
    - Unlike shared hosting, it's not sharing the resources in a first-come-first-serve type of format. Instead, it have specific resources assigned.
    - Flexibility: Scalable plans that grow with your website (Think of it like an investment) (+)
    - Security: More customizable control with root access(+)
    - Cost: Middle option between shared web hosting and dedicated (=)
    - Entry barrier: Require basic tech knowledge and vague idea how much storage and bandwidth needed (-)
- Dedicated Hosting
    - In Dedicated Hosting, a single server hosts a single website, have complete control of the server and its security system.
    - Security: No chance of security issues from neighboring sites, can take security measures and customize ourself (+)
    - Better Customer Support: Usually 24/7 (+)
    - Performance: Server uptime higher with total control on whatever features is neeeded. (+)
    - Cost: Most Expensive (-)
    - Technical Knowledge: To set up, run or manage, etc. the administration and management on the server. Share hosting is covered by service provider. (-)
    - Note: Dedicated Hosting fully managed by the service provider is also available. But even more expensive.
- Cloud Hosting
    - Provides hosting for websites on virtual servers. These servers pull their computing resources from an extensive underlying network of physical web servers.
    - Which makes applications and websites accessible using cloud resources. Unlike traditional hosting, solutions are not deployed on a single server. 
    - Cost-Effective: Reduces the high costs of owning the infrastructure to host your website. You are only required to pay for the resources you use, and therefore you don’t waste money on unwanted resources. (+)
    - Scalability and Flexibility: A cloud server requires payment for only the used resources. It has the possibility to expand and shrink. (+)
    - Backup and Disaster Recovery: With cloud hosting, disaster recovery is rarely needed since data backups are automatic (+)
    - Accessibility: Due to internet, information that is stored in the cloud makes it much easier for that data to be accessed from anywhere and at any time regardless of the machine. (+)
    - Bandwidth Issue: Cloud is dependent to internet, therefore whoever uses it must have good connection in order to enjoy the full benefit of cloud hosting.
    - Expensive: May have hidden costs. Users are must be careful and be familiarize with it. (-)
    - Security: Anything from the internet is not secured, can suffer severe attacks and security breaches (-)
    - Downtime: Service providers/vendors can also face technical difficulties on their side. Reasons could be power loss/faulty internet connections, maintenance of data etc. (-)

#### Important notes to self so that it's not confusing:
- Shared hosting ‘share’ space(bandwidth, storage, memory etc...) on a server with other websites. This can be thought of like renting a room in a shared house – you’ve got your own little area, but you’re part of a larger space.
- VPS hosting similarly as shared hosting but it provides dedicated virtual partition for each user, making sure resources are always available. Have a good resource that don't need to share with anyone. This can be thought of like renting a condo with many apartments but small dedicated space. 
- VPS(One server) vs Cloud(Multiple Server -> pulls multiple resources)
- How can you imagine? Imagine cloud is a house yet have multiple electricity resources so even if one down it will still work by replacing.
