What is HTTP?
- HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load web pages using hypertext links(fetching resources).
- Flow -> a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

HTTP request
- It is a way that how the internet communicate where the web browsers ask information that's needed to load a website.

HTTP request contains:
1. HTTP version type
2. URL
3. HTTP method
4. HTTP request headers
5. Optional HTTP body

What’s an HTTP method?
- HTTP verb(It indicates the action that the HTTP request expects from the queried server) - GET/POST/UPDATE/DELETE

What are HTTP request headers?
- Text information stored in key-value pairs
- Communicate core information such as what browser the client is using what data is being requested.
- E.g. (Authorization: BASIC Z3Vlc3Q6Z3Vlc3QxMjM=, Cookie: name=value,  Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT, Accept: text/plain , Content-type: application/json  etc...)

What’s in an HTTP request body?
- Body of an HTTP request contains any information being submitted to the web server like form data.

What’s in an HTTP response?
- Web clients (often browsers) receive from server in answer to an HTTP request. 

HTTP response contains:
1. An HTTP status code
2. HTTP response headers
3. Optional HTTP body

What’s an HTTP status code?
3-digit codes most often used to indicate whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed. Status codes are broken into the following 5 blocks:
1xx Informational
2xx Success
3xx Redirection
4xx Client Error
5xx Server Error

What are HTTP response headers?
- Convey important information such as the language and format of the data being sent in the response body.
(E.g. date: Thu, 21 Mar 2000 12:00:00 GMT, status: 200, content-tyoe: text/html; , status: 200 etc.....)

What’s in an HTTP response body?
- In most web requests, this is HTML data which a web browser will translate into a web page.

What's a Protocol?
- A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers. Communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data that is being exchanged. The set of rules that defines a format is called a protocol.

What is HTTPS?
- HTTPS(Hypertext Transfer Protocol sercure)
- Data sent is encrypted (Secure Socket Layer[SSL]/Transport Layer Security[TLL])
- Install certificate on web host

What happen when a website is being clicked? e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings 
Let's break it(URL) down!
1. Scheme (https://) -> Tells browser to make a connection with TLS which encryptes the data... others like ftp://, mailto://, or file://. These are other protocols that browsers know how to handle.
2. Domain (en.wikipedia.org) -> Domain name of the site. It is the memorable address which points to a specific server’s IP address.
3. Path (/wiki) -> is the path on the server to the requested resource... think of it as directory structure of files and other directories on computer. It’s a way to organize resources regardless of static or dynamic files.
4. Resource (/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) -> name of the resource on the website you want to view

- Browser looks up and get DNS record with the IP address to find the server on the internet and establish a connection.
- DNS data is cached at different layers between your browser and at various places across the Internet. Starting from ISP(internet service provider) to recursive DNS lookup which ask multiple DNS servers around internet until DNS record is found.
- Browser initiates TCP connection with the server sending packets through the routers using TCP(Transmission control protocol) to find server with IP address

CDN
- Nowadays, content delivery network(CDN) is more popular as it cache static and dynamic content closer to the browser.
- A CDN is a globally distributed network of caching servers that improve the performance of your site or app.
- E.G. AWS CloudFront which is part of the AWS global network.
- Requests from the client browser get to take advantage of this private network that has ultra-low latency and high availability.
- Instead of relying on the public internet routing infrastructure and being subject to extra hops, redeliveries, and packet loss, the client browser request gets to take a ride on the AWS global network. The request is intelligently routed through the most performant location to deliver content to your browser.
- Once the browser finds the server on the Internet, it establishes a TCP connection with the server and if HTTPS is being used, a TLS handshake takes place to secure the communication. 

(GET /hello-world HTTP/1.1) Request line contains (contains information that the server can use to determine what the client wants to do):
    - request method, which is one of GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE etc....
    - the path, pointing to the requested resources
    - the HTTP version to communicate with

response contains:
    - a status line
    - response headers, telling the browser how to handle the response
    - the requested resource at that path, contents like HTML, CSS, Javascript, or image files, or data for the client
Content-Type response header will tell what to do with the first resource, afterwards it will make additional requests to get JS/images/CSS/data etc....


Whole Cycle -> 1. Click on URL -> 2. Browser looks up IP address for the domain -> 3. Browser initiates TCP connection with the server -> 4. Browser sends the HTTP request to the server -> 5. Server processes request and sends back a response -> 6. Browser renders the content

Proxy server
- Intermediate program or computer used when navigating through different networks of the Internet.
- 2 types of proxies
 1. Forward proxy that handles requests from and to anywhere on the Internet.
 2. Reverse proxy taking requests from the Internet and forwarding them to servers in an internal network.
