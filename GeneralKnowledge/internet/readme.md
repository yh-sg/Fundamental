## What is AJAX?

- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

- AJAX just uses a combination of:
    - A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    - JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

**Advantages**
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Send data to a server - in the background
