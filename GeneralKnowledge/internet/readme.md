## What is AJAX?

- AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

- AJAX just uses a combination of:
    - A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
    - JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

**Advantages**
- Update a web page without reloading the page
- Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
- Send data to a server - in the background

# Network Protocol Layers (Top to Bottom)

1. Application (Application Layer Protocol) (E.g. HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, POP etc...)
2. Transport (Transport Layer Protocol) (E.g TCP, UDP etc)
3. Internet (Internet Layer Protocol) (IPv4, IPv6)
4. Network (Link Layer Protocol) (Ethernet - WiFi standards, MAC addresses, switches)

- Network communication splitted into 'layers' with different protocols on each layer
- Each layer is self-contained and only needs to know how to interface with the layer above and below it

## Transport Layer Protocols (TLP) - Either TCP/UDP
###### TCP(Connection-oriented transport) and UDP(Connectionless transport)
