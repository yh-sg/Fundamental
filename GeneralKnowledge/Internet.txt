Some terminology to look out for....

Network (Devices that are connected to each other....) whereas Internet (global network of networks communicate through a standardized set of protocols)

Domain Name System(DNS)
 - A domain name gets the IP address rather than you need to memorize address such as 111.111.111.111
 - First, when url is clicked. It will check cache(which can be OS/browser/router) otherwise on internet it will check the 4 servers.
 - Recursive server - DNS resolver which keeps on asking start from root to TLD to Authoritative. Afterwards, it'll cache.
    -> DNS Root Name Server(Index of all the servers that will have the information being queried.) 
    -> (Top level domain)TLD name server (.com) 
    -> Authoritative name server (google.com) 
    -> Get IP Address!! Cache it with common ones like browser/OS/Recursive Resolver. (Security issue -> Cache poisoning)

(wikipedia.org)domain name -> (en.wikipedia.org/zh.wikipedia.org/jp.wikipedia.org)subdomains

 - 2 types of top level domain names.
    1. Generic top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .edu, .org, .gov --- Authority over these domains is usually delegated to private organizations.
    2. country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .sg .jp .io --- Administered by authorities in each country.

IP(Internet protocol) address
 - IPv4(N.N.N.N where N is binary ranging 0-255 aka 32-bit(2^32) address) vs IPv6(X:X:X:X:X:X:X:X in hexadecimal whereas zeroes are omitted aka 128 bit address)
 - Dynamic IP addresses vs Static IP addresses

Switch(Cannot use wireless technology, use access point(Big company/places) for wireless which gives Wi-Fi signal) 
- Allow computers in the same environment to communicate with each other with cables to lan ports...
- LAN (Local access network) connects devices within a restricted area

Packet
- Data which were being chopped/divided into packets and being sent to other devices through the cables of the internet
- 2 parts -> 1) Header(Informations like source/destination/length of the packet) 2) Checksum value(Detect if a packet was damaged or not)

Router
- Enable devices to connect to the internet with cable by ISP (Internet Service Provider)

Reliability

Security protocols - Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) & TLS

Cloud?

How does wireless internet work?
