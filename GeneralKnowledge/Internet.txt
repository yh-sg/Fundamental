Domain Name System(DNS)
 - A domain name gets the IP address rather than you need to memorize address such as 111.111.111.111
 - First, when url is clicked. It will check cache(which can be OS/browser/router) otherwise on internet it will check the 4 servers.
 - Recursive server - DNS resolver which keeps on asking start from root to TLD to Authoritative. Afterwards, it'll cache.
    -> DNS Root Name Server(Index of all the servers that will have the information being queried.) 
    -> (Top level domain)TLD name server (.com) 
    -> Authoritative name server (google.com) 
    -> Get IP Address!!
 - 2 types of top level domain names.
    1. Generic top-level domains (TLDs) such as .com, .edu, .org, .gov --- Authority over these domains is usually delegated to private organizations.
    2. country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .sg .jp .io --- Administered by authorities in each country.
