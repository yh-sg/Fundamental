# Array

An array is a collection of similar data elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It is the simplest data structure where each data element can be accessed directly by only using its index number.

Static Array vs Dynamic Array
- Static Array: Fixed length container containing n elements indexable from the range [0, length-1]
- Dynamic array: Grow and shrink in size.
    - 4x4 = 16 bytes of storage
    - When exceed, it will copy original array to another memory with which double in size 4->8->16->32 x 4 Bytes

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Insert</td>
            <td>O(n) or O(1) for push but if dynamic array requires growth it's O(n)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Delete</td>
            <td>O(n) or O(1) for pop</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Access</td>
            <td>O(1)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Search</td>
            <td>O(n)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

```diff
+ Fast Lookup(With good collision resolution)
+ Fast push/pop
+ Ordered
- Slow insert
- Slow delete
- Fixed Size(Static Array)
```

# Hash table

A hash table is an nordered, key value pairs where data maps keys to values. It is one part of a technique called hashing (hash function).

A hash collision occurs when more than one value to be hashed by a particular hash function hash to the same slot in the table or data structure (hash table) being generated by the hash function.

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Insert</td>
            <td>O(1)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Delete</td>
            <td>O(1)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Search</td>
            <td>O(1)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Space</td>
            <td>O(n)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Note: If hash collision occurs, it'll all become O(n)

```diff
+ Fast Lookups
+ Fast inserts
+ Flexible Keys
- Unordered
- Slow key iteration
```
